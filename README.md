# SEPSIS-ANALYSIS-USING-API
A machine learning model that seeks to learn and predict if people have SEPSIS or not.



## Introduction

In this project, we aim to create an API that might be requested to interact with an ML model. This is an interesting solution when you want to keep your model architecture secret or to make your model available to users already having an API. 



## Description
We will construct a machine learning model utilizing the [Sepsis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaunguynnghunh/sepsis?select=README.md) dataset available on Kaggle. The primary objective of this model is to forecast whether a patient is afflicted with sepsis or not.

Once the model is created, we will develop an Application Programming Interface (API) using FastAPI, facilitating seamless communication with the model. The subsequent step involves deploying the API on the Hugging Face platform.

## Project Processes
Build an API integrating an ML model using FastAPI.

1.  Build an ML model to predict the [Sepsis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaunguynnghunh/sepsis?select=README.md).

2.  Build an API using Fast API to embed the ML model built.

3. Deploy API in Hugging Face



## Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

They both have long command-lines which have the same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ` ; ` but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
